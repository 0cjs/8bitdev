#   activate - enter a b8tool environment
#
#   This is currently a hack that depends on this script being in
#   $B8_PROJDIR, so it works for 8bitdev but maybe not other b8tool
#   users. We we like to figure out a way to genericise this, but it
#   somehow needs to know B8_PROJDIR and that doesn't seem possible to
#   find out automatically if this is part of b8tool, since the b8tool/
#   subdir need not be directly under the project dir, nor need the build
#   dir be $B8_PROJDIR/.build. Perhaps we should move to some sort of
#   config file in the project dir that b8tool stuff could find?
