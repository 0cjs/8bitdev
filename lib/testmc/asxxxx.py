class AxSymTab(SymTab):
    ''' The symbol table of an ASxxxx module, including local symbols.

        ASxxxx calls sections "areas"; the `Symbol` section value is
        the area number. The addtional `areas` property is a tuple of
        `Area` objects indexed by area number.

        The source data for the symbols in relocatable sections has
        non-relocated (pre-link) symbol values; the `readsymtabpath()`
        function will call `relocate()` to read the area information
        and modify the symbol values to their relocated values. If
        relocations have been done (using `relocate()`), `relocated`
        will be `True`.

        This is normally generated from symbol and area tables in a
        .sym file or .lst/.rst listing file (both are the same format
        for the symbol table section) using the .map file to path up
        the relocations for relocatable areas. The .map and debugger
        files include only the global symbols that are exported by the
        module, and we want to be able to use local symbols when
        testing.

            if that file is not present (e.g., it was given without an
            extension) or does not contain the symbol and area tables.

            This may attempt to read any of the following files for
            the symbol table data it needs:
            - `.sym`: non-relocated local and global symbols from the
              assembler, if this file exists.
            - `.rst`: Generated by the linker from the `.lst` file.
              While the listing has relocated addresses, the symbol
              table, if it was in the `.lst` file, does not.
            - `.lst`: non-relocated local and global symbols from the
              assembler, if a listing but no .sym file was generated.

            It will further always try to read the `.map` file
