To-do List
==========

#### Features

- "Omniscient debugging"; dump initial memory and symbol table to a
  file, followed by a trace of full execution (instruction, resulting
  register values and the memory change for each step) of a call.
  Probably also want a tool that can dump arbitrary memory at any step.

#### Third-party Tools

- Use [omni8bit](https://github.com/robmcmullen/omni8bit) (`pip
  install omni8bit`) front end for emulator startup/run here?
- Look into [Omnivore](https://github.com/robmcmullen/omnivore) (`pip
  install omnivore`), a visual tool providing tools and front-ends for
  toher tools: various emulators w/debuggers; binary editor;
  disassemblers; ATasm 6502 cross-assembler; graphics and map editors.
