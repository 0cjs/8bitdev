''' testmc.midump - Dump a memory image in human-readable format

    This currently reads only CoCo Disk BASIC binary files, as
    produced by ASlink. It should be fairly easy to extend to do work
    with 16-bit Intel hex or Motoroala S-record files, though we'd
    have either to add an option to force the file format, try to do
    auto-detection, or both.

    Ouput lines are in a typical standard address/hex/char format,
    though not exactly the same as either `hexdump -C` or `xxd`. The
    biggest difference is that the line address is always a multiple
    of 16 and locations without data are displayed as spaces.

    Lines are displayed in order of memory location, regardless of the
    order of records in the input file. If there are overlapping
    records, separate lines with the same address will be displayed
    for each overlapping 16-byte chunk. Possibly we should emit a
    warning to stderr if overlapping chunks were found during the
    dump.
