;   prscreenchar/ascii: ASCII-only screen character print
;
;   Requires: prchar

;   â™¡*   Print any (8-bit) value as its screen code
;
;   The output is always a character from the printable ASCII range.
;   Printable character are printed as-is; non-printing characters are
;   printed as a space.
;
;   This is a generic routine used for testing and as an example, since
;   ASCII systems do not have separate a separate "screen code" character
;   set. On systems that do have such a set, `prvischar` would obviously
;   use that. (On those systems it may require going around the BIOS print
;   routines, unless they support printing screen codes in some way.)
;
;   To provide a more convenient API, this preserves the original character
;   in A, along with all other registers and flags.
