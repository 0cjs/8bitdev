How apple music should work.

The idea is to "compile" a music buffer of pitch-duration pairs for one,
two, or three voices and then play them out in real time.

n.b.: i can't think of any reasonable place to put the music buffer other
than in the high-res page.  Maybe someday we'll think of some clever
swapping strategy, but let's use high-res for now.

n.b.:i heard a rumor that you can specify amplitutde to the music card.  if
so, i don't think its worth the extra storage to specify amplitude for
every note.  maybe just choose a good default for now.
--------------------

Here are the primitives:

NVOICES (1, 2 or 3) specifies the number of voices.  (This is purely
to save storage inthe music buffer---with only one voice you can
generate a tune three times as long as with three voices.)  NVOICES
reconfigures the music buffer, so it destroys whatever tunes
were in there.

NOTE <pitch> <duration>  -- takes two numbers and adds them on to the
list for the current voice.  pitches are numbered chromatically.  some
special value should be reserved for a pitch of "rest".  if you can
figure out how to generate a percussion sound, then some special pitch
should be reserved for that, too.  duration should be in units ofthe
shortest not we want. 1/10 second seems about right.

VOICE {n, where 1 <= n <= current setting of nvoices}
says that the next NOTES will be added to VOICE n

PLAYMUSIC (abb PM) plays the stuff in the buffer.  in the 11 version,
PM destroyed the buffer, due to programmer braindamage (i was the
programmer). it should not do this.  if apple allows you do specify
amplitide, a reasonable way to do it would be as an arg to PM.

--------------------

How this is implemented.

Keep around, for each voice, pointers to the beginning and end of the voice
info in the buffer.  E.g., with NVOICES 2, the buffer is split in
half. Also keep a "register" for each voice.  An entry in the buffer
is a pitch-duration pair <a byte should suffice for each>

When a note command is given, add a new pair to the right place.  You
can optimize storage for consecutine notes of the same pitch, e.g.,
so that
NOTE 10 1
NOTE 10 3
will end up putting a 10,4 pair inthe buffer.  with typical use, this
optimization is not worth it.

here's what to do for PM

load each voice register with the first P-D pair for the voice.

do until all voices are done
    for each voice:
      stuff the pitch into the music generator
      decrement the duration
      if the duration is zero load the next P-D pair
      if voice has run out stop generating for this voice


note that a percussion sound of n should actualy be treated as a
"gritch" of 1 followed by a rest of n-1.

--------------------
11logo also had a MUTYO command which did a real-time frb to the music
box, e.g, for programming the keyboard to act as an "organ".  play
with this.  we can probably just as easily write this as a Logo
function using .DEPOSIT
