8bitdev Development Notes
=========================

Packages needed for old Python builds of third party software:

    sudo apt install build-essential \
      libsdl2-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libsdl-image1.2-dev libsdl1.2-dev \
      libzip-dev liblz4-dev imagemagick

To-do List
----------

#### Bugs

- Once the `dw` being wrong-endian for big-endian machines bug is fixed
  (still present in ASL build 280), add `N dup XXXX` test for `dw`.
- We should probably be checking the assembler version in `std.CPU` files
  because our code makes assumptions about various newer features being
  available. (Possibly t8dev should be doing this too.)

#### Cleanup

- scr/tmc68/biocode: use `ds prchar-$` (current PC) to org routine locations
- Make a better `repr()`/`str()` for `testmc.generic.Machine` so that
  `assert R(...) = m.regs` looks nicer (and maybe provides useful info).
- testmc.generic.machine.Machine.load_memimage() currently sets the
  PC to `None` if there's no entrypoint in the file it's loading. It
  should probably instead set the PC to the reset vector, or the first
  address loaded, or something like that.

#### Build/Test System Fixes

- extract src/mc68/{hello,cjsmon} loadbios() to test framework
- remove more `  cpu 6502` from files and put in unit test framework?
- Rewrite Test in Python and replace UNIT_TESTING symbol per comments.

#### Features

- Add the `testmc.generic.IOMem` interface to `testmc.mos65`.
- Add "hexadecimal integers" to framework with `__repr__()`s that
  print as `$EA` or `$FFFF`. Construct perhaps with `A(0xFFFF)`
  (address) and `B(0xFF)` (byte)?
- "Omniscient debugging"; dump initial memory and symbol table to a
  file, followed by a trace of full execution (instruction, resulting
  register values and the memory change for each step) of a call.
  Probably also want a tool that can dump arbitrary memory at any step.

#### Third-party Tool Support

- Figure out a convenient but quiet way to somehow inform the user of
  which tools he's using, particularly system-supplied vs. .build/.
- Allow configuring tools as "dontuse," w/no build or install, and
  code that needs the tools simply not being built.

#### Third-party Tools to Consider Using

- Use [omni8bit](https://github.com/robmcmullen/omni8bit) (`pip
  install omni8bit`) front end for emulator startup/run here?
- Look into [Omnivore](https://github.com/robmcmullen/omnivore) (`pip
  install omnivore`), a visual tool providing tools and front-ends for
  other tools: various emulators w/debuggers; binary editor;
  disassemblers; ATasm 6502 cross-assembler; graphics and map editors.
- [CLK] emulator, which covers a dozen different systems we use.

Other Notes
-----------

#### pytest-xdist performance

8bitdev, t8dev and r8format together have some 2500 unit tests virtually
all over which are extremely short. On cjs's Ryzen 7 7735HS (mini-desktop),
workers (`-n#`) vs. performance is as follows. `0` indicates pytest-xdist
not used (`-n0`), and the figures are wall clock and test run time averaged
over three runs.

        Workers     Wall        Test
            4        4.3         2.0
            8        4.5         2.3
           16        4.8         2.6
            2        4.8         2.6
            0        6.1         3.9
            1        6.7         4.5

Thus in `pyproject.toml` we set `-n4` as the default. This adds about 0.2
seconds overhead to pytest  to the shortest possible run of a single test
using the 6502 simulator, but given that there's over 2s over overhead,
this moves the shortest case from 2.2s â†’ 2.4s, and with more tests being
run very quickly the cost of starting workers starts to pay off.
