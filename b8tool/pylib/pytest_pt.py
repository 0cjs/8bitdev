''' Pytest plugin to find/execute .pt files as tests

    This plugin adds a new collection hook that recognizes files
    ending in ``.pt`` and loads them as test files. The ``python_files``
    `configuration option`_ need not be changed to include ``*.pt``.

    This will work only in Python â‰¥3.5 because it uses new importlib
    routines. Further, it does not (as traditional pytest did) change
    the import path per ``--import-mode`` to add the directory in
    which the file resides, since this was needed only with the older
    import routines and caused its own set of problems. If you are
    importing from paths that were automatically added, you will need
    to change your test framework configuration to explicitly add the
    necessary paths.

    The module name for file ``foo.pt`` will be ``foo_pt``. This is
    done only to make test framework debugging easier; since these
    modules are not added to `sys.modules`, there should be no problem
    with collisions as there is in standard pytest loading system,
    which is not yet able to use the ``py`` package's
    ``ensuresyspath='importlib'`` option on `pyimport()`.

    Filename collisions in ``__pycache__/`` between pytest-compiled
    and standard-compiled files are not an issue (pytest appends
    ``-pytest-M.N.P.pyc`` to the bytecode filename) but collisions can
    happen if you create both ``foo.pt`` and ``foo_pt.py`` files and
    ask pytest to run both as tests, so don't do that.
