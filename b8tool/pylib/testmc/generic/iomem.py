''' A memory with (mock) I/O devices.

from    io  import BytesIO

class IOMem(bytearray):
    ''' This is a memory and I/O device simulator. Typically it would be
        used as the backing storage for a CPU simulator.

        As well as acting as a memory store with a little more error
        checking than a standard `bytearray`, it also allows attaching
        functions to be called on reads from or writes to particular memory
        addresses to simulate I/O devices. See the `setio()` function for
        details on how to do this.

        To help surface errors when running tests, the following additional
        safety features not usual to Python sequences have been added:
        1. It is not possible to change the length of memory. `del will
           raise a `TypeError` and attempting to replace a slice with a
           value of different length will raise a `ValueError`.
        2. Negative indexes are invalid and will raise an `IndexError`.
        3. Slices that extend beyond the end of the memory are invalid and
           will raise an `IndexError`. (I.e., while `b'01'[:8]` will return
           a two-byte sequence , the same on this will raise an exception.)

        When using this as backing storage for a CPU simulator object, you
        will probably want to use `copyapi()` to copy the public API of
        this to your object so that users don't need to access it through
        your memory attribute (which may be considered private).

            If `input` has a `read` method it will be used as the source of
            data for reads from `addr`; ``read(1)`` must return a `bytes`
            (or similar) of length 1. Otherwise `input` will be passed to
            `BytesIO()` to be used as the initial value.

            If `output` has a `write` method it will be used as the
            destination of data for writes to `addr`; ``write()`` will be
            given a `bytes` of length 1 for each byte written.
